# Intro site with introduction of me (obsolete)

My current portfolio site is available under: [selfref.dev](https://selfref.dev/)

## Description

Written using Vue.js with a taste of TypeScript bindings and Vue Class Component (Vue files). My simple intro site where I keep focus on overviewing myself. At this time only `Projects` page is available fetched directly through GitHub API but I'm planning to add more general informations as well as move my actual blog site.
