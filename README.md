# Intro site with introduction of me

## Description

Written using Vue.js with a taste of TypeScript bindings and Vue Class Component (Vue files). My simple intro site where I keep focus on overviewing myself. At this time only `Projects` page is available but I'm planning to add more general informations as well as move my actual blog site ([TimsManter.NET](http://timsmanter.net/)) to keep it simple.
